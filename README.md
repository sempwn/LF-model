This model is a stochastic microsimulation of Lymphatic Filariasis infection in a population. The accompanying paper in Parasites & Vectors titled *Modelling strategies to break transmission of lymphatic filariasis - aggregation, adherence and vector competence greatly alter elimination* by Irvine et al. can be found [here](http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/8/1/547)
